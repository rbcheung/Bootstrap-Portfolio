# Bootstrap Portfolio

## My Task

This project was made to help me to learn how to position elements on a webpage using Boostrap. This is something that I wanted to get better at so learning this skill was a big motivation for doing this project. The website is a portfolio page that showcases projects that I will work on in the future. It also has an about me section and links to contact me. This is a dummy website as of now however I may adjust it in the future and use it to showcase all my projects in one place. I wanted to make it look similar to the previous portfolio made with flexbox but instead using bootstrap to achieve a similar result. To achieve this I needed to achieve the following requirements:


* A navigation bar

* A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use Bootstrap's navbar or create your own.

* Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.

* Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

* A hero section

* A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
A work section

* A section displaying your work in grid.

* If you need to use placeholder image use placehold.coLinks to an external site.

* Use Bootstrap cards for each project.

* The description should give a brief overview of the work.

* Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

* A skills section

* List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
An about/contact section

* An About Me section in the same row.

* A footer section

* All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

* All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
